## ðŸ“¡ From Global Playlist to Personalized Streaming â€” Introducing [M3USe](https://m3use.projectmoose.xyz)

Hey folks â€” if you've used or followed this repo in the past, you might remember it started as an automated GitHub Actions workflow that created a public M3U playlist of livestreams. You could request channels, and I'd manually add them to the playlist for everyone.

But things have evolved.

### ðŸŽ‰ Meet [M3USe](https://m3use.projectmoose.xyz) â€” A Web App for Custom Livestream Playlists

âœ… Add livestreams from **YouTube**, **Twitch**, and **Dailymotion**  
âœ… Build your **own playlist** â€” no more global list  
âœ… Use with **any IPTV player** (VLC, Kodi, TiviMate, etc.)  
âœ… Your playlist, your links, your rules

ðŸ’¡ No more waiting for manual updates or one-size-fits-all playlists. You just paste the channel URL, and the backend takes care of the rest.

# twitch_to_m3u
m3u links of twitch streams for localhost

### How to use
> Edit the `autorun` (`.sh` for linux, `.bat` for windows) file, and change `127.0.0.1` to the IP of the device that you want to be the local server (eg.: `192.168.1.5`).

> Save the file

> Run `autorun`

> Add streams into the file `streams.txt`

> If the server IP is `192.168.1.5`, find the playlist at `192.168.1.5:9001/playlist.m3u`. Add this to tivimate (or any player that supports m3u)
